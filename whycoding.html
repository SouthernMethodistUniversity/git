<p>Understanding computing: This section is to familiarize you wth important foundational concepts and to give you a framework for understanding the types of computational methods you can use on a projects, including: minimal computing, tool choice or coding.  Finally, this session aims to give you language to conceptualize what is possible and to communicate more effectively with partners.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Understanding the affordances and limitations of a computational approach for your project will help you better imagine, plan manage your project. Even if you are not directly involved in the coding aspect, this will give you the tools to better collaborate with those who will.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What is the command line and why is it like this?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The command line is a text-based way of interacting with your computer. Working in command line helps you make a mental model of how you environment is layed out. This environment is the result of a series of choices, made by humans.</p>
<p>You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. If you’re curious, though, you can read more about them <a class="reference external" href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line">here.</a> The shell we use (whether terminal, shell, or bash) is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions.</p>
<p>And yes, “the command line” is also laden with masculine and military metaphors, which is reflective of the history of computing and programming.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As Wendy Hui Kyong Chun discusses in <a class="reference external" href="https://direct.mit.edu/grey/article/doi/10.1162/1526381043320741/10837/On-Software-or-the-Persistence-of-Visual-Knowledge">“On Software, or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge,” (2004)</a> almost all computers (as in human comput-ers) in the US during World War II were young women. Human computers received commands from analysts — predominantly men with the military — that they then had to interpret and act upon the machine. As Chun argues, “computation depends on ‘yes, sir’ in response to short declarative sentences and imperatives that are in essence commands … The command line is a mere operating system (OS) simulation” (page 34). The command line (of computers today) receives these commands as text that is typed in.</p></li>

<h2>Why is the command line useful?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-the-command-line-useful" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Initially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar. Why step away from a GUI point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we’d like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you’re stepping into the kitchen. It’s more work, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/#whyshouldievencareaboutusingtheterminal">but there are also more possibilities.”</a></p>
<p>The command line allows you to…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up your programming environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Run programs you create.</p></li>
<li><p>Access the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.</p></li>
<li><p>Control other computers remotely.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Wring a script or program (programming!) allows you to automate a series of repetitive tasks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That’s all right! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about <strong>showing information</strong> that the computer has, or <strong>modifying or making</strong> things (files, programs, etc.) on the computer.</p>

<p>By this point in our academic careers, most of us have figured out some ways we like to interact with computers. Whether that involves avoiding them as much as possible or constantly testing new software, we likely have some ideas about how we feel comfortable getting things done. How would you show a person who had never seen a computer, say <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/LIdFa1qLgNQ">Kimmy Schmidt</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/Xq29uTtKW4M">Brendan Fraser in <em>Blast from the Past</em></a>, how to <em>do</em> something on your computer?</p>
<p>Many of us would explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on athe  graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced “gooey!”).</p>
<p>Another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we’ll be typing in either Git bash (Windows) or terminal (OSX) to tell the computer directly what task we’d like it to perform.</p>

Is it a familiarity with the basic components of programming languages, so as to be able to understand how code is structured and produced?

<!--- Text 

* text can be code, and text can be data. 
* When does text become code? 

* For those of us comfortable reading and writing, the idea of "text-based" in the context of computers can seem a bit strange. As we start to get comfortable typing commands to the computer, it's important to distinguish "text" from word processed, desktop publishing (think Microsoft Word or Google Docs) in which we use software that displays what we want to produce without showing us the code the computer is reading to render the formatting. Plain text has the advantage of being manipulable in different contexts. 

Let's take a quick moment to discuss text and text editors.

### What is text?

We want to give a general sense of this "text" we keep mentioning. Theire is what 'text' means in your discipline" there is text as 'data', and there is the 'plain text' you use to communicate to your computer using commands and scripts.

* For those of us in the humanities, whether we follow literary theorists who read any object as a "text," or we dive into philology, paleography, codicology or any of the fields [David Greetham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Greetham_(textual_scholar)) lays out in *Textual Scholarship*, "text" has its specific meanings. 

As scholars working with computers, **we need to be aware of the ways plain text and formatted text differ.** Words on a screen may have hidden formatting. Many of us grew up using Microsoft Word and don't realize how much is going on behind the words shown on the screen. For the purposes of communicating with the computer and for easier movement between different programs, we need to use text without hidden formatting.

![Word Doc](../sections/images/worddoc.png)


If you ask the command line to read that file, this Word .docx file will look something like this

![Cat Word Doc](../sections/images/CatWordDoc.png)

Word documents which look like "just words!" are actually comprised of an archive of extensible markup language (XML) instructions that only Microsoft Word can read. Plain text files can be opened in a number of different editors and can be read within the command line.

### Plain text

For the purposes of communicating with machines and between machines, we need characters to be as flexible as possible. Plain text includes characters of readable material but not graphical representation.

According to the [Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/), "Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes."

Plain text has a few main properties:

* "plain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied. Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable."
* Plain text shows its cards &#8212; if it's marked up, the markup will be human readable. Plain text can be moved between programs more fluidly and can respond to programmatic manipulations. Because it is not tied to a particular font or color or placement, plain text can be styled externally.

A counterpoint to plain text is rich text (sometimes denoted by the Microsoft rich text format ".rtf" file extension) or "enriched text" (sometimes seen as an option in email programs). In rich text files, plain text is elaborated with formatting specific to the program in which they are made.

**Note:** Software like Microsoft Word or Excel add formatting (and can sometimes changes made by the auto-formatting can introduce errors). "Excel errors happen all the time, simply because the software is often the first thing to hand when scientists process numerical data. [Scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21355674/human-genes-rename-microsoft-excel-misreading-dates)

## Text editors

*An important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor.* A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .csv, or .md. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as .docx or .rtf, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly. 

While it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor. Choosing a text editor has as much to do with personality as it does with functionality. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), user options, and "hackability" vary from program to program. 

### Editors vs. IDEs

When it comes to editing text and writing code, you can use either a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Text editors tend to be more lightweight solutions, while IDEs try to provide a lot of features to help you write code and tend to target specific languages. There are a lot of exceptions to that description, but the distinction isn't that important. Just know that editors will sometimes describe themselves as IDEs, and that there's a slight difference in philosophy between them.

### Note about Special Characters
"Special characters include characters that are not found on a standard English-language keyboard or that are not one of the 128 characters of the US-ASCII character code set. Examples include characters with diacritics and special symbols, such as the copyright sign or an ampersand. How these characters are represented varies in HTML and XML." [UNL Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/TEI) 
* More information on: [Characters, Glyphs, and Writing Modes.](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html)
* "TEI tags describe the characteristics of a given text. For example, TEI tags may be used to indicate paragraph and line breaks, pagination, and major divisions of a text such as volumes, chapters, and sections. In addition, tags may be placed around typographical characteristics such as text that is underlined, italicized, superscripted, etc., and around text that needs special emphasis such as foreign words, misspellings, proper names, etc." [UNL Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/TEI) 
* Example: ["In transcribing a manuscript, it might be desirable to distinguish among three distinct forms of the letter r."](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/tei/tei-idx?type=HTML&rgn=DIV1&byte=281938)

# What does this all mean? Why are we telling you all this? 


Advantages of using an cloud based M II account:
- M II is already set up to work well on any device, and it will have software pre-installed accessible via Internet.
- Ownership and group access (access is contingent upon association with SMU).
- You don’t have to install any software on your own computer.
 - Cloud-based notebooks

Advantages cloud-based notebooks give instructors: 
- More control on what we give access to for participants.
- Can create structured projects for participants.
- Versions are more controlled compared to installed versions.
- Reproducible and sharable
- Less reliant on strength of computer.
- You may also see references to [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in other digital humanities workshops.  
- We are choosing for the sake of pedagogy and time to skip local installation. However, if you want to learn to code, you may want to installing a virtual envorinment with the porgramming language you want to learn and an IDE. 

### Jupyter Notebooks
* If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter Notebooks, take a look at one of these introductory lessons.
* [Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks - ITHAKA Constellate](https://ithaka.github.io/tdm-notebooks/getting-started-with-jupyter.html) 
  * Description: This lesson introduces Jupyter notebooks and Python for absolute beginners. If you are completely new to text analysis, this is the place to start.
* [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks - Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks)


# Programming languages  

 Which language should you learn? 
 - Just as choosing which language you will use for your foreign language requirement is based on your research question, there are multiple programming languages you can choose to learn for digital humanities. R and Python are the most common. 
  * How much of the language do you need to learn? 
  * Does your project require basic fluency or only reading comprehension? 
  * [Task-Driven Programming Pedagogy in the Digital Humanities](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/32151/1/Task-DrivenPedagogy_BirnbaumLangmead.pdf) 

## Python 
* [Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
* [Eric's text analysis lesson in Python.](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/think-play-hack/blob/master/tutorials/python/textmining_python.ipynb) 

## R 
* [R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
* Learning R fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the Internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

## R vs. Python
* [Comparing Python vs R Objectively.](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-vs-r/): “where Python is more object-oriented, and R is more functional.”

- Here are two examples of using Git and GitHub for teaching—[a syllabus using a GitHub repo](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204) and [a syllabus using a repo and GitPages](https://digitalhistory.github.io/).
- [Fake New Corpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus), an open source dataset composed of millions of news articles mainly intended for use in training deep learning algorithms for purpose of fake news recognition. The dataset is still work in progress and for now, the public version includes only 9,408,908 articles.
- [C+=](https://github.com/TheFeministSoftwareFoundation/C-plus-Equality), a feminist programming language, created by The Feminist Software Foundation to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.
