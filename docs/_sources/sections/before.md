# Before the workshop
In this section, we want to introduce some central steps that you want to take before you get started with this workshop. For instance, there are workshop suggestions that you may want to engage with before you start this workshop, some required or recommended software installations, some files from external sources to download, etc. :green_circle:  indicated what is *required* before the session. 

## Git vs. GitHub: What's the difference? (required)
* Watch this video before the session. 
[!["Git vs. GitHub: What's the difference?"](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/git/blob/main/docs/_images/gitvgithub.png)](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wpISo9TNjfU)
* While watching consider: Why might using GitHub be useful even if you are not working on a development team? 




## Prior Knowledge (recommended)
Having some knowledge about how to use the command line will be central for anyone who wants to learn about git and GitHub. This workshop will assume some knowledge of the command line.
If you do not have experience or prior knowledge of the command line, you may want to review the following workshop: [Introduction to the Command Line](https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line) 


## Required Software or accounts (required)
Some software is required for you to participate in this workshop. This is a list of the prerequisite installations that are required of you, a link to each of their instructions and an indication as to whether it is required or not.

Plain Text Editor
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/visual-studio-code.md) (recommended) You can use any plain text editor but for our purposes, Visual Studio Code ("VS Code") will be used.
 - [Download and install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [Directions](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/installations/microsoft-visual-studio-code/)

- :green_circle:[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (required) :green_circle:
- You need to have a GitHub account for the purposes of this workshop. It is free to sign up via this link. If you are an educator or a student, you might also qualify for the GitHub Education Pack, which you can read more about here: https://education.github.com/pack

# Contexts
Why am I learning this? Why does it matter? How will it help my project? Learning new digital skills is an investment of your valuable time, so it is reasonable to want to know—essentially—what will I get out of taking this workshop? The materials below help situate the skills you are about to learn within a larger context of how they are used, by whom, and to what ends.

## Ethical Considerations
- Digital tools and the skills required to use them are part of our culture and, therefore, never neutral. Digital humanists and social scientists consider the ethical challenges and responsibilities of the tools and methods that they use. The following materials are designed to introduce you to issues you may want to consider as you learn this new skill and decide how to integrate it into your own research and teaching.
- Within the nebulous open-source ecosystem, GitHub is an important place for storing and finding code. What if your open source code was used by an entity or for a purpose that did not agree with your ethics? For example, the platform received backlash from employees of GitHub and users of the platform when it was revealed that they held a contract with ICE. In this case, neither group wanted their code shared and used by ICE in detaining and deporting immigrants.

## Readings before you get started (optional)
-The readings listed below situate what you are about to learn in cultural contexts, such as a particular humanities or social science field, the information or computer sciences, or popular discourse. The purpose of the readings is to provide a theoretical framework you can use to contextualize how you intend to use the skill or tool introduced in this workshop.

## Projects related to Introduction to Git and GitHub (optional)

The following are sample projects that use the skill or tool (either implicitly or explicitly) that you are about to learn. Some skills that are foundational may seem not to lead to a specific project goal that you have in mind. You might be surprised to learn that the following projects depend on the skills learned in this workshop.

- [GCDI's Digital Research Institute](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum) has been improved and built out over time using GitHub to store and track multiple projects that use the same base of repositories, and new versions.
- "F-ing Algorithm" project uses Git and GitHub to create multiple versions of their project in different languages—([Chinese](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm) and [English](https://github.com/labuladong/fucking-algorithm/tree/english)), and to create a [GitBook](https://labuladong.gitbook.io/algo-en/i.-dynamic-programming/analysisofdynamicprogramming) for sharing their work.
- Here are two examples of using Git and GitHub for teaching—[a syllabus using a GitHub repo](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204) and [a syllabus using a repo and GitPages](https://digitalhistory.github.io/).
- [Fake New Corpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus), an open source dataset composed of millions of news articles mainly intended for use in training deep learning algorithms for purpose of fake news recognition. The dataset is still work in progress and for now, the public version includes only 9,408,908 articles.
- [C+=](https://github.com/TheFeministSoftwareFoundation/C-plus-Equality), a feminist programming language, created by The Feminist Software Foundation to smash the toxic Patriarchy that is inherent in and that permeates all current computer programming languages.
- [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), an open-source Javascript library for building mobile-friendly interactive maps.
